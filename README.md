# Scrape Stanford Events

Automatically sift through the great daily events at Stanford University to find free AI and ML related on-campus lectures. 🏛

The python script scrapes Stanfords [`/today`](https://events.stanford.edu/today/)-page and finds events that can be specified in a regex names `pattern` (currently set to find Machine-Learning related events).

If the day holds an exciting event of your acquired taste, you shall be informed, and the browser of your choice will pop up the event's detailed description plus Stanford's [searchable map](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/).

Once in a while there's also free food. 🍓👍
